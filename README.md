# RAG Chatbot

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot using the LangChain library and HuggingFace embeddings. The chatbot leverages document retrieval capabilities to provide more contextually relevant responses by retrieving information from a set of documents and using it to generate coherent answers.

## Features

- **Document Retrieval**: Retrieves relevant documents based on a user's query using the FAISS retrieval system.
- **HuggingFace Embeddings**: Uses pre-trained models from HuggingFace to convert text into vector embeddings.
- **Customizable**: You can easily add more documents to the knowledge base.
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Engages with users in a natural conversation flow.
